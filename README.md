# Use-of-preposition  
  A preposition is a word that helps connect nouns and pronouns with a verb or adjective in a sentence. The five types of prepositions are simple, double, compound, participle, and phrase prepositions. Prepositional phrases contain a preposition plus a noun or pronoun?
There is nothing wrong with ending a sentence in a preposition like to, with, for, or at. English speakers have been doing so since the days of Old English. The people who claim that a terminal preposition is wrong are clinging to an idea born in the 17th century and largely abandoned by grammar and usage experts in the early 20th.
A preposition is a word—and almost always a very small, very common word—that shows direction (to in "a letter to you"), location (at in "at the door"), or time (by in "by noon"), or that introduces an object (of in "a basket of apples"). Prepositions are typically followed by an object, which can be a noun (noon), a noun phrase (the door), or a pronoun (you).
